## Mechanics

Wizards and Book of Ancient Secret Warlocks are able to learn from each others spell books.

Here are the exact Rules as Written summaries of each mechanic

### Wizard: Copying a Spell into the Book

Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell
of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is
of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare
the time to decipher and copy it.
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique
system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You
must practice the spell until you understand the sounds
or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook
using your own notation.
For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you
expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well
as the fine inks Vou need to record it. Once you have spent
this time and money, Vou can prepare the spell just like your
other spells.

### Warlock: Book of Ancient Secrets

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to
your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you
can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or
less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you
can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level
of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and
costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

## The List

The list contains non wizard spells, as Book of Ancient Secrets 
warlocks can learn from any class list provided it is a ritual.
As such spells are marked for whether or not a Wizard can learn
them or a Ritual caster can learn them. It is also possible to
learn spells by finding someone with Arcana profficiency and having
them use their downtime to make you a spell scroll you can then
learn from, the lists beneath will be cheaper however as they
will not requrie the funding of the creation of a spell scroll.
