Celebration my comrades! Our fair Kingdom's great device. 
The Conjunction will finish charging tommorow , and be activated!. 
Though we shall be sacrificing our great police force it will deal a cipping blow to those devils, The Jibo. 
We shall crush them beneath our feet and we shall have our final victory! 
Look for the lilac flames in the north tommorow. 
That will indicate the end of this war and ever lasting peace! 
Now, Let us feast in celebration!
