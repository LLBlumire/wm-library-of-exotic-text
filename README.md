# Westmarches Library of Exotic Texts

The library is a small two floor building in the western district. It's
bottom floor serves as a public space and its top (accessed through a
staircase at the back) is private living quarters. The bottom floor
looks like a simple room with sparse shelves and texts with
translations into common from the source language.


The library of exotic texts is a collection of all the known text 
samples found throughout the marches, in both their original language
and in the common tongue as translated by Alice Karel or other aides.

The library is designed as a public resource for the collation of
information, and to help those who wish to learn foreign languages by
supplying them with a large corpus of bilingual text.
