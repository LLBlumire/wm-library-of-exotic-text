# Westmarches Library of Exotic Texts

The library of exotic texts is a collection of all the known text 
samples found throughout the marches, in both their original language
and in the common tongue as translated by Alice Karel or other aides.

The library is designed as a public resource for the collation of
information, and to help those who wish to learn foreign languages by
supplying them with a large corpus of bilingual text.
